Welcome to FFBE Equip Next, an online tool for [Final Fantasy Brave Exvius](http://www.finalfantasyexvius.com/). Features include building units/parties, searching units/gear, and saving user inventory/units/espers.

Check it out here: https://ffbeequipnext.com/

# How to run locally
This first point explain how to get a barebone FFBE Equip local server in 5 mintes.
This server won't have login capability.
See further points for a full featured local server.

## Install docker and docker-compose
See instructions from here : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
(Docker-compose is already installed when you install docker on Windows or MAc)

## Download FFBE Equip docker-compose.yml and .config.json.sample
From https://github.com/lyrgard/ffbeEquip/tree/master/docker_compose and put them in a folder of your choice.

Rename `.config.json.sample` into `.config.json`

Edit `.config.json` to change the `secret` value into some random characters

If you want to use Google Drive for personal data make sure to set the enabled flag in the google section of .config.json to true.

## Run docker-compose
In the folder where you saved the files, run `docker-compose up -d`

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to verify it correctly worked.

# How to update your local server

In your install folder, run :

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

# Install a fully featured local server

## Obtain OAuth client credentials from the Google API Console
OAuth is used to authenticate users, while Google Drive is used to store the user data such as item inventory, unit collection, espers, etc...
  1) Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
  2) Click Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID -> Web Application
  3) Choose a Name: (e.g. ffbeEquip OAuth Client ID)
  4) Under Authorized JavaScript origins: http://localhost:3000
  5) Under Authorized Redirect URIs: http://localhost:3000/googleOAuthSuccess
  6) Click Create - A modal will appear with your client ID and secret, but exit the modal and click on the download icon to the right of the client ID to download as JSON.
  7) Open the `.config.json` file and paste the content of the downloaded file in the `google.oAuthConfiguration` value
  8) Go to Dashboard -> Enable APIs. Search for Google Drive and enable it
   
## Obtain and set up a Firebase account (optional)
Firebase is used to share information between users such as builder links to unit/party builds.

Links generated on your local server will only be valid for your local server.
This section is probably **NOT** needed for a personal use local instance

  1) Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
  2) Create a project
  3) Choose a Project Name (e.g. ffbeEquip Dev)
  4) Disable Google Analytics and click Create Project
  5) Set up storage for that project 
      1) Click Storage in the side menu -> get started
      2) Secure Rules -> next
      3) Choose nearest Cloud Storage location -> done
      4) Under Storage -> Rules -> Edit rules - replace with the following:
          ```
          service firebase.storage {
            match /b/{bucket}/o {
              match /{allPaths=**} {
                allow write: if request.auth != null;
                allow read;
              }
            }
          }
          ```
  6) Add a Web App to your project
      1) Click Project Overview in the side menu
      2) Under "Get started by adding Firebase to your app", click the Web icon (</>)
      3) Under Register app, choose an app nickname (e.g. ffbeEquip Dev) - no need to set up hosting
      4) Under Add Firebase SDK ignore the code and click Continue to Console
  7) Generate a private key
      1) In Project Overview in the side menu, click the gear icon -> project settings
      2) Under Service accounts -> Generate new private key -> Generate Key
      3) Rename the JSON file to `firebase_config.json` and move it into the googleOAuth folder
   
## Enable CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS needs to be enabled so that anyone may read the Firebase files when given a builder link.

This section is only needed if you use firebase with your local instance.

  1)  Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home
  2)  Click "Activate Google Cloud Shell" in the top right, this will open a terminal shell
  3)  Create a file called `cors.json` and open it with an editor (e.g. vim, nano, etc...)
        ```bash
        touch cors.json
        nano cors.json
        ``` 
  4)  Add the following code and save the file:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "origin": ["http://localhost:3000"],
            "method": ["GET"],
            "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
          }
        ]
        ```
  5) Run the following but replace [myproject] with the storage bucket URI (you can copy from the Firebase Storage page)
        ```bash
        gsutil cors set cors.json gs://[myproject].appspot.com
        ```
